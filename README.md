# Asset-Manager

> in development...

The system is a user asset management system. It utilizes Prisma as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to connect to a PostgreSQL database.

The system consists of three main models: "User," "Wallet," and "Asset."

This system allows users to manage their wallets and financial assets. Each user can have multiple wallets, and each wallet can have multiple assets associated with it. This enables users to efficiently track and manage their financial assets.
